QA-html
=======

These are the starter files for the Q&amp;A Assignment.

To complete the assignment:

* Fork the repository to your Github account
* Edit the index.html file to add proper markup to the page (I will show you how to use cloud 9, http://c9.io )
* Answer the questions (also with valid and semantic markup)
* Make sure to __add__ and __commit__ and __push__ your changes
* Submit a Pull Request when you're done

If you have problems or questions you can email me or use the discussion board on our class site at https://www.levelflylearning.com

I will give time in class on the day the assignment is due to help with Github and C9 issues. If you're stuck and can't get immediate help, then write your HTML as you know how and I can help you with this workflow.
